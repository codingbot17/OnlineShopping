Hey everyone!!
<br>
E-commerce would not be possible without online shopping carts. Shopping carts allow consumers to shop virtually by selecting products from online shelves and checking out with a simple click of a button.

You can elevate your customers shopping experience by understanding the basics of an online shopping cart. Whether you are in the early stages of setting up an online store or you have been selling online for years, the right shopping cart solution can help increase conversions and build a loyal customer base.
<br><br>
Many online shoppers browse stores with no intention of making a purchase. Instead, they might bookmark items for later and forget about them. This is why reminding customers about products in their shopping carts is essential.
